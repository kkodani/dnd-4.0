My attempt at an implementation of D&D 4e.

Current Features:
	-type hello/hey/hi for greetings
	-type rename "NAME" to rename yourself (default is "player")
	-type in an item to display its stats (not many items yet)
	-type roll "NUM" to roll a dice from one to "NUM"
	-press up/down to cycle through input history

To be added:
	character creation
	modifiers on roll command
	add items to item list
	combat
